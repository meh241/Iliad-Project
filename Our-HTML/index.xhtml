        <p><em>This project focuses on the Iliad, specifically books twenty three and twenty four.
                We wanted to look at not only how grief is portrayed throughout the Iliad, but how
                the character's repsonses, whether it be emotional or physical, give the reader
                further insight into the grief of the story. We also focused on how the character's
                actions are further displays of their grief, and how specific emotions come through
                in these portrayals.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Research Question:</strong>
            <em>How is grief connected with complex emotions like anger, wrath, and lament as seen
                in the reaction of Achilles to the death of Patroclus?</em></p>
