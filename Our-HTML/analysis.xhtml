            <p>For our project, we we wanted to examine the language of grief and emotional response
                in Books 23 and 24 of Homer’s Iliad. Looking specifically at the character Achilles,
                but also at Patroclus, Hector, Agamemnon, Priam, and the pantheon of Gods, we
                analyzed their actions, categorizing them in accordance to whether or not the action
                was appropriate, who it was directed at, the type of emotion felt at that moment,
                who it was directed at, and what the relationship was between the person doing the
                action and the one receiving the action. We ended up choosing these identifiers
                because they reveal and probe into the nature of grief in the Iliad. Looking at if
                the grief was inappropriate or not gives readers insight into how different
                characters have a tendency to abuse grief or not. On top of that, we wanted to take
                a closer look at what emotion was being portrayed, regardless of whether it was via
                words or actions. We also wanted to ensure that the direction of the emotions were
                marked down as well, because often the characters' grief was at no one, or towards
                divine beings. Looking at the data we collected through this markup, we determined
                that grief, specifically the grief felt by Achilles, is the catalyst for a myriad of
                responses, and that there isn’t one specific way that these emotions are conveyed.
                By studying one of the oldest texts we have available, it becomes evident that
                humans have long struggled with the complexity of emotions that come with loss,
                specifically when it comes to violent, untimely death, and that our responses may
                not always make sense. For example, Achilles is both cruel and merciful, displaying
                the emotions of divine wrath when mutilating the body of Hector, but sparks a
                feeling of wonder in Priam when he returns the body of Hector to his father.
                Achilles grieves the death of his lover, Patroclus, displaying lament, but displays
                extreme anger over the loss as well. There is a duality that becomes apparent
                through our research, one that reveals the true intricacy that is the feeling of
                grief.</p>
